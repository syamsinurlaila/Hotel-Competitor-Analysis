Project: Hotel Competitor Analysis

This repository contains the methodology and findings of a comprehensive competitor analysis for PT Swiss-Belhotel International in the Bali market. The project was executed to provide key insights into the competitive landscape, inform pricing strategies, and identify opportunities for market differentiation.

Overview
The objective of this analysis was to move beyond a simple price comparison to understand the full competitive environment. The project involved gathering a wide range of data on key competitors, including their pricing models, amenities, guest reviews, and digital presence, using a combination of online research and direct data collection.

Methodology & Data Collection
Our approach to data collection was multifaceted to ensure a robust and accurate analysis:

Online Research: We collected data from sources such as Online Travel Agencies (OTAs), social media, and competitor websites to analyze pricing tiers, room types, and guest reviews.

Direct Phone Calls: A key part of our methodology was to contact competitors directly to gather real-time data on room availability, non-public promotions, and specific amenity details not listed online.

All collected data was compiled into a structured analysis table to allow for a direct comparison of each competitor across key metrics.

Key Findings & Recommendations
Pricing Strategy: The analysis identified a clear tiered pricing model among competitors, revealing opportunities for dynamic pricing and channel management.

Amenities & USP: We pinpointed unique selling propositions (USPs) of competitors and identified service gaps that our hotel can leverage to attract a specific market segment.

Customer Experience: By analyzing guest reviews, we identified common pain points in the market and made recommendations to improve our hotel's guest satisfaction and loyalty.

This repository serves as a portfolio piece showcasing my ability to conduct thorough market research and provide data-driven recommendations to support business strategy.
